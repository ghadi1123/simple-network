Introduction: 

This project aims to build a network connecting three companies, allowing them to communicate and share information seamlessly. We'll utilize various protocols and IP  addressing to ensure smooth operation .
 
 Protocols :
In computer networking, OSPF optimizes routing, DHCP automates IP address assignments, and DNS translates user-friendly domain names into numeric IP addresses. These protocols are essential for efficient communication and resource management in the interconnected 
digital realm

- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a dynamic routing protocol commonly used in 
large-scale networks to efficiently exchange routing information. It operates on a linkstate algorithm, where routers communicate information about the state of their 
connections, enabling the network to dynamically adapt to changes.

-DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol 
that automates the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration 
information to devices in a network. DHCP simplifies network administration by 
dynamically allocating IP addresses, ensuring efficient and organized utilization of 
available addresses.

-DNS (Domain Name System) serves as the internet's address book, translating userfriendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on 
the network. DNS is crucial for the functionality of the internet, enabling users to 
access websites and services by typing in easy-to-remember domain names rather 
than numeric IP addresses
